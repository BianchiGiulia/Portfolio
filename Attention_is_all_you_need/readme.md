Attention Is All You Need - Implementation and Application
==========================================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains my implementation of the Transformer model as presented in the seminal paper ["Attention Is All You Need"]([URL](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)). The key focus of this project is to apply the Transformer model to a classification task, demonstrating its versatility and power in handling complex machine learning challenges.

Implementation
--------------

The `Attention.ipynb` notebook in this repository details the step-by-step process of implementing the Transformer model. Key highlights include:

*   Understanding and coding the multi-head attention mechanism.
*   Developing the encoder and decoder stacks.
*   Integrating positional encoding for retaining the order of the input data.

Model Training and Classification Task
--------------------------------------

The model has been trained on  a subset of the [`HumSet` dataset](https://blog.thedeep.io/humset/) for a text multilabel classification task. Training details include:

*   Dataset preprocessing and preparation.
*   Training parameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).
*   Evaluation metrics and results discussion.

Usage
-----

To use this model:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook: `Attention.ipynb`.
