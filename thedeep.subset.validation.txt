Reported access to food notably increased in centraland southern Unity State since February, as shown by comparative Map 3. In June, 80% of assessed settlements in Koch, Leer, Mayendit and Panyijar reported to have adequate access to food, which represents a sharp increase since February when only 25% reported the same. Improvements have been most notable in Leer where 97% of assessed settlement reported adequate access to food in June, compared to only 11% in February, while in Mayendit proportions increased from 25% in February up to 46% in June. These findings suggest that massive scale-up of food assistance has successfully lifted up food security levels in central Unity. However, these positive developments seem to be highly dependent on food assistance being maintained at the same levels, to prevent a relapse into previous conditions of extreme food insecurity. Regular food distributions and access todistributions by beneficiaries, however, heavily depend on security in the area which remains highly volatile and unpredictable.

Fifty-five percent (1 417) of the new suspected cases and the two deaths were from the Central Region, with an attack rate of 52 cases per 100 000 population.

In addition, the high proportion of haemorrhagic cases among the deaths, standing at 73%, could be suggestive of circulation of virulent strains/genetic variants of the virus.

Distance to learning centres was reported as barrier especially by parents of younger children and then gradually declining with age. 40% of parents for 3-5, 30% for 6-14 and 26% for 15-18. This was linked to challenging terrain—especially during rainy season—as well as dealing with hazards and threats along the way (see below). ? Safety threats at learning centres was identified as access barrier particularly by girls, and cited as priority area for improvement. The specific nature of threats remained unidentified by this assessment 01/06/2018 5 and requires further analysis. This was more acute for girls than boys at age 6-14 (32% vs 25%) and aged 15-18 (32% vs 18%). ? CGD discussions suggested adolescent girls were concerned not having gender-segregated classrooms and learning centres being unsecure from intrusions leading to a degree of shame in attending education. Given the overall lack of services for adolescents, this should be interpreted as the perception of adolescent female respondents on access barriers. Furthermore secondary Data contradicts these findings, repeatedly citing that learning centres are perceived as safe spaces. ? CGD data suggest that for adolescent girls, these concerns are exacerbated due to the fact that those learning spaces that do exist are not gender-segregated classrooms, and that spaces are not secure from intrusion by people who should not be able to enter the space, such as men from the immediate community physically entering or observing activities inside learning facilities. ? Work at home or outside home was identified as barrier by 20% of parents of primary aged children (6- 14). The percentage increases to approximately 50% with parents of adolescents (15-18), while the lack of education possibilities might negatively impact this figure. ? Around 40% of parents of adolescent girls and 33% for adolescent boys reported that education was not appropriate for children of their age. This is likely linked to conservative social norms constraining mixing with the opposite sex and restricting movement outside the household after the onset of puberty, as well as the belief that education is of limited use for girls who will grow up to fulfil primarily domestic responsibilities. ? Mental health and disability were not mentioned as barriers by the study’s survey, which is in contradiction with secondary data analysis indicating psychosocial trauma linked with displacement being a factor limiting children’s abilities to access education.",2

UNHCR estimates that over the last seven years, approximately 120,000 children have been born in Lebanon to Syrian refugees. Around 78 per cent do not have their birth registered with the competent authority (the Foreigners’ Registry), and over 50,000 children under five years do not have a birth certificate registered with the Nofous, the local registry office. Birth registration and nationality are essential to protect individual rights; statelessness can lead to legal and socioeconomic marginalization, and has been linked to increased vulnerability to trafficking and recruitment of child soldiers. Registration with the Foreigners’ Registry and documentation of nationality will also be essential for eventual returns of refugees to Syria.Obstacles to birth registration and acquisition of Syrian nationality by refugees include a lack of awareness, unfamiliarity with procedures (which can differ markedly from those in Syria), prohibitive costs (particularly where parents have failed to regis ter a birth within a year), and lack of registration among parents. Government entities have been working to combat this problem, working with municipalities and local authorities. NGOs and UN agencies have also been active in providing legal support and raising awareness. However, more still needs to be done, including possible amendments to nationality and personal status laws, increasing awareness of the need for registration and the proper procedures among refugees and local authorities, and ensuring that accessible avenues exist for refugees to register, including minimizing costs and administrative obstacles.

136,"Through October and November 2016 the TFPM has observed a decrease in the conflict-related displacement of 172,062 individuals (-7.9%). This is primarily a result of further data validation procedures deployed in Taizz (decrease of 152,892 individuals), wherein from August to September key informants ability to gather reliable data was impeded by mobility restrictions due to active hostilities, and enumerators were in many cases compelled to collect data remotely. Further significant decreases have been observed in Hajjah and Sana’a (61,260 and 57,732 individuals, respectively). On the other hand, there has been an overall increase in the conflict-affected return population by 17,658 individuals (+1.7%).

14981,"Health Facilities Devastated by PNG Quake21 MARCH 2018, PORT MORESBY - A third of all health facilities have closed in Hela and Southern Highlands Provinces as a result of the Papua New Guinea earthquake.  On 26 February, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck Papua New Guinea, triggering landslides, affecting water sources and wiping out houses, health facilities, people and crops. More than 190 aftershocks have been recorded, according to the United States Geological Survey, including one as recently as 20 March.  Results of a joint National Department of Health (NDOH) and World Health Organization (WHO) assessment show that 25 out of 77 health facilities in the two worst-affected provinces are no longer functioning. The total number of closed facilities is potentially higher, as data from eight health centres remains unavailable due to access constraints.  “This disruption to health service provision comes at a time when people are most in need of care,” said Dr Luo Dapeng, WHO Representative to Papua New Guinea. “As aftershocks continue, affected communities are dealing with injuries and psychological trauma. We’re also worried about potential outbreaks of epidemic-prone diseases. We must move swiftly to restore health services.”  Overcrowding in informal camps and a lack of access to clean drinking water and sanitation increase the risk of disease outbreaks. Vaccination coverage was low prior to the earthquake and the country was already facing outbreaks of malaria, pertussis and measles.  Roads, rivers, airfields and bridges have been impacted by the earthquake in a part of the country prone to violence and insecurity. Access to affected communities has therefore been extremely challenging.  “Responding to the health needs in Papua New Guinea is definitely not easy,” said Dr Luo. “But we’re determined to find ways, alongside our partners, to deliver life-saving health services to even the hardest to reach communities.”  WHO is supporting the National Department of Health (NDOH), provincial health authorities and partners with information management, technical guidance and logistics. As the Health Cluster lead agency, WHO plays an active role in coordinating the activities of 25 health partners in order to align efforts, fill gaps, avoid duplication and ensure that response efforts reach those most in need.  The Organization is also supporting the strengthening of disease surveillance and has pre-positioned medical supplies in preparation for potential outbreaks, including seven diarrhoeal disease kits and rapid diagnostic tests for dengue.",4

14740,"Deir-ez-Zor governorate is located in the south east of Syria and was controlled by ISIL from December 2014 till September 2017. Only the airport and five neighbourhoods in the city were under government control. The government held area became totally surrounded and was besieged by ISIL. During the besiegement, all supply routes to the city were cut and the only corridor to bring food to the besieged community of around 93,000 people, was via the airport. As a result, food accessibility significantly decreased in the city due to deteriorating market functionality, no access to farming fields, extremely limited food availability and overall breakdown of livelihoods. As a result, adoption of severe negative food consumption-based and livelihood coping strategies significantly increased in the area, with the worst situation in the last quarter of 2015 when food stocks were reported to be almost exhausted and some severe cases were registered of destitute households asking better-off families to adopt their malnourished children as they could not feed them. At that critical stage, food assistance airdrops were the only option to support the besieged population and save them from likely starvation. Between April 2016—August 2017, WFP conducted 309 airdrops to Deir-ez-Zor city, delivering 5,879 MTs of food aid. As a result of the airdrops, overall food accessibility in the city remarkably improved and the prevalence of severe negative coping strategies declined. However, the general food security situation was identified to be still stressed as the needs were very high. Between June—September 2017 the government-led assault on ISIL in Deir-ez-Zor intensified and in September 2017, the siege was finally lifted hereby allowing the main supply route that links Deir-ez-Zor to other governorates (Ar-Raqqa, Homs, Damascus) to be re-opened. Commercial flows to Deir-ez-Zor city have now improved and have positively impacted the city’s market overall functionality, food availability, food diversity and accessibility in the area as well as encouraging many displaced households to return to the city. An estimated 70,000 returnees have returned to the city since the siege. Key informants reported that most of the returnees are returning from Damascus and Homs and the rate of return is increasing daily especially among civil servants. The humanitarian situation for internally displaced people (IDPs) who escaped from rural areas of Deirez-Zor during the ISIL controlled period are indicated to be the worst-off in the city in terms of living conditions and food security situation, in particular regarding those who are residing in public shelters in the Harabish neighbourhood. The level of destruction in Deir-ez-Zor city is high and over 60 percent of the city is affected. The population density (160,000 people) is mainly concentrated in a few neighborhoods (Al-Qosur, Joura, AlMuwzafeen and Harabish). As a result, expensive rent and accommodation was reported to be one of the main problems in Deir-ez-Zor city due to overpopulation of habitable areas in addition to the severe lack of electricity, insufficient clean water supply, heavy dependence on humanitarian assistance and dysfunctional sewage system.",1

Though most Syrian refugee children are bilingual in Arabic and Kurdish, many can neither read nor write in the local Sorani Kurdish dialect used in KRI. This situation presents challenges to the transitional plan put in place by the KRG on integrating refugee children into KRG public schools. This plan is further compounded by the fact that Syrian parents though having lived in the KR-I for 6 years, are hopeful that they will one day return to their country and are worried that the Kurdish education certificates that their children will attain while in Iraq will not be recognized when they return. Thepreference therefore for most refugees is to have their children learn in Arabic. Unfortunately, very few Arabic schools are available. As an example, Erbil has a total of 20 Arabic primary schools and only 4 Arabic secondary schools which limits access to education for refugee children, especially the youth as the schools are few, overcrowded and children often must travel long distances to access them. In a survey conducted by UNHCR, 26 per cent of children are not attending school because of the unavailability of Arabic schools in their locality.

WFP reports that IDPs living in collective settlements continue to require food assistance; however, the assessment findings suggest that food security actors should transition to early recovery or agriculture support efforts for host populations who have access to arable land. • WFP conducted a similar assessment in Borno’s Damasak town in Mobbar LGA in early December, which found more than half of the surveyed population to be food insecure—including 5 percent who are severely food insecure. As a   2    result, WFP recommended that humanitarian actors target food assistance for households who have limited access to income-generating opportunities or lack assets to support livelihoods, rather than providing general food assistance across the LGA. WFP also highlighted that although arable land is available, many farmers are unwilling to use land further than 2 miles from town centers due to security concerns. • Food security actors should utilize cash-based assistance to meet food needs in Borno’s Konduga town, according to a late 2017 REACH Initiative assessment of food assistance modalities among displaced and host populations in the town. Nearly 60 percent of surveyed households preferred cash-based assistance to in-kind aid; primary reasons for the preference for cash-based assistance included freedom to select preferred foods and flexibility to use assistance for both food and non-food needs. In addition, more than 80 percent of households have access to markets. However, food affordability remains a challenge; on average, households had insufficient cash to meet food needs on 12 days per month. The assessment also found that the majority of vendors selling staple food items would likely have the capacity to increase stocks to meet the higher demand for goods.",8

2034,"The food security and nutrition situation has been deteriorating since 2014. Farming technology is rudimentary in South Sudan. Crop production is largely in the hands of very poor farmers who cannot produce enough for their families and depend on purchased food for several months. Major rural development programmes have been on hold due to insecurity. Since 2015, food price hyperinflation has devastated purchasing power and decimated livestock holdings. Fuel is extremely scarce and expensive. Markets are very fragmented and during the rainy season roads become impassable almost everywhere in the country. The regional Horn of Africa crisis is also affecting availability of food commodities: commercial imports into South Sudan will further reduce as traders have no economic incentive due to domestic monetary collapse – or seek premium profit, pushing retail food price upwards that few households can afford. A critical period in the agricultural calendar is approaching, providing the main opportunity to tackle countrywide food insecurity. Food security will be heavily influenced by the success of the coming cropping season. If farmers can plant and security remains sufficiently stable that they can weed, carry out pest control and harvest their crops, this will have positively impact food security for the remainder of 2017. Given that many households have already lost most if not all of their productive assets, it is very likely that the needs for external assistance will last well into 2017, and perhaps even beyond. The distribution of fishing kits is already ongoing in critical famine areas where people are living in the swamps, offering a much-needed lifeline",3

Prices were underpinned by the strong procurement from institutional bodies for the replenishment of their stocks.

7801,"As shown by Map 6, education has been reported lowest in Mayendit, with only 7% of assessed settlements reporting access to education, followed by Rubkona at 9% of assessed settlements and Leer at 24%. It must be noted, however, that education services in Rubkona are likely underrepresented asareas where education services are most extensive, such as Bentiu PoC or Bentiu town, are unlikely to be covered by AoK data. In Leer and Mayendit, low proportions reporting access to education is possibly attributable to the highly volatile security situation in the region. According to education partners operating in Unity State, there are currently no formal education providers in Leer and only few in Mayendit, as many of the schools in these two counties have been looted and closed down during the last months.In absence of formal services, education is often provided by volunteer community members which teach the children with little to no school supplies, often in exchange for a small fee, as has been reported during FGDs. This is supported by a recent DRC rapid assessment to Bieh in Koch County which found that community volunteers there were teaching the children under a tree without curriculum and without education materials.17 Where suitable, provision of learning material to those improvised learning spaces could improve interim education provision until formal services are established. Further assessment would be needed to evaluate feasibility of such support.Most cited reason for absence of formal and informal education services in 63% of assessed settlements have been conflict-related, such as insecurity, displacement of teachers and school buildings destroyed by fighting, as shown by Figure 10. Improvements in access to education are therefore highly dependent on the security context, and economic and structural condition of the country. As long as security hampers education efforts and economic instability does not allow for adequate payment of public officials, it is unlikely that access to education will improve in Unity State in the near future.",2

Host communities are also affected with weak access to the necessary resources for their own food production, and face high levels of poverty and malnutrition. The situation is further compounded by climate variability that negatively impacts the production system resulting in poor crop yields and livestock productivity, which in turn affect households’ livelihood and food security. The number of people facing acute food insecurity in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa has significantly reduced over the past year from 4.7 million (March?May 2017) to 2.3 million (March?May 2018).

Among those displaced in rural areas, it is estimated that 21,800 are in areas of high tension. These households are unable to access humanitarian assistance and markets in Wau town, as they would need to cross areas controlled by armed actors. These areas include the payams of Baggari, Bessilia, Kpaile, and Wau South. In Raja, fighting between Government forces and armed opposition has displaced the majority of the population in Raja town, who have fled to Mangayat, Temsah, Kata, Gossinga, Korcham, Boro Medina, and Deleba. Local authorities reported that a large number of people also crossed into Sudan following the fighting.Conflict in Wau and Raja continues to disrupt normal livelihood activities including cultivation, fishing, and the collection of wild foods. The fighting that occurred in April 2017 displaced households at the time of land preparation. It is expected some households are not engaged in agricultural activities as a result, leading to lower planting at the state-level. In Wau, given extremely high prices and limited income-earning opportunities, households are relying on fish, wild foods, and humanitarian assistance. Evidence suggests households are still facing food consumption gaps, but given that a high percentage of the need was reached by assistance, this county is in Crisis (IPC Phase 3!). High concern remains, though, for the estimate 21,800 people in villages around Wau who do not have access to humanitarian assistance and it is expected food security outcomes are worse among this population.

Gunmen stormed the Government Girls Technical College in Dapchi on February 19, seizing 111 schoolgirls in a carbon copy of the abduction in Chibok in 2014 that caused global outrage.  All but six of the Dapchi girls were returned to the school just over a month later. Five died in captivity while the only Christian among them is still being held.  The school reopened on April 30 but one teacher, who asked not to be identified for fear of official sanctions, said most pupils have stayed away because they were still afraid.  'We have a total student population of 989, and out of that number only 314 have resumed after we reopened,' he said. 'Of the 314 that returned, 299 are writing their final examinations and will be leaving school in July.  'So, technically, we can say only 15 students have resumed, who will be continuing their education here.'  Bashir Manzo, who headed the abducted girls' parents association, said children were being kept at home because of a lack of security personnel.  'There are only a handful of soldiers and vigilantes guarding the school, not more than 25 in all, a number grossly inadequate to protect our daughters,' he told AFP.  'We believe even the 15 girls that returned will go back home once their seniors finish their examinations and leave.'  The education commissioner for Yobe state, Mohammed Lamin, angrily dismissed parents' concerns and said 'everything humanly possible' had been done to make the school safe.  'We deployed soldiers, police, civil defence paramilitary and vigilantes to the school providing security 24 hours,' he said. 'How can they say security is inadequate? Do they have such level of security in their homes?'  'Six girls have so far being married off because their parents have lost interest in sending them to school' - Bashir Manzo, of Dapchi abducted girls' parents association  Security has been an issue in Dapchi since it emerged that soldiers had been withdrawn before the kidnapping and claims that warnings about Boko Haram's arrival went unheeded.  Some children who escaped the abduction vowed never to return.  Another parent, Kachalla Bukar, said there were now even fewer troops in the remote town, which lies 62 miles north of the state capital Damaturu.  'The route through which the kidnappers came in and out of the town is still without military or police presence,' he said. 'This route leads up to Chad.'  The state government's failure to show sympathy and provide moral support to families of the abducted schoolgirls had not inspired confidence, he added.  Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari had visited the town but as yet, there had been no condolences sent from the state government to the families of the girls who died or support for the remaining girl in captivity, he alleged.  Parents had expected improved security measures, including raising the school's low perimeter wall, said Bukar.  The Boko Haram conflict has destroyed schools across northeast Nigeria, which had poor levels of education even before the conflict began in 2009, particularly among girls.  Last September, the UN children's agency UNICEF said more than 2295 teachers had been killed and 19,000 displaced while nearly 14000 schools have been destroyed.  Manzo said UNICEF secured admission for 20 of the abducted girls into Tulip International College, a Turkish-run private school. Parents of the other girls were left to try to get them admission into other public secondary schools in the state but without success.  Bukar said parents were losing faith with the authorities.  'This leaves many parents with no option but to marry off their daughters because they have no means of taking them to schools outside the state,' he said  'From reports at our disposal six girls have so far being married off because their parents have lost interest in sending them to school,' Manzo said.  Four of the students writing their final examinations who refused to return to the school could also be joining them, he indicated.  Safe Schools InitiativeIn the aftermath of Chibok, a Safe Schools Initiative was launched in Nigeria in May 2014. It started with an investment from the Global Business Coalition for Education and was supported by the A World at School movement, raising funding from business leaders, government and government donors.  When Nigeria's new government took power in 2015, many of the Safe Schools Initiative's activities were not pursued as a policy priority.

13833,"Simultaneous humanitarian crises had a major impact on children and families in Niger in December and throughout 2017. Niger faced epidemic outbreaks, including meningitis C, measles and hepatitis E virus (HEV), humanitarian consequences of insecurity in the South East and North West of the country, and the humanitarian consequences of forced return from Algeria and Libya, as well as acute malnutrition throughout the country. Direct attacks by Boko Haram continued in the Diffa region, with violence against local communities and school canteen looting. Threats of humanitarian staff kidnapping led to a restriction of humanitarian movements in the field. In 2017, OCHA reported a total of 141 civilians affected, 60 people kidnapped (43 children), 10 schools and 10 health centers attacked. Nevertheless, authorities and humanitarian community have already agreed on the need to scale up the analysis and planning for longer term, resilience-building interventions. In Tillabery and Tahoua regions the security measures in place since March 2017 continue to worsen the structural vulnerabilities of the communities, and the expansion of military presence increases the risk of major displacements, and even though it has not yet the case, the humanitarian community keeps a contingency plan updated and is ready to be activated should the intervention threshold be exceeded. In terms of outbreaks, in December 3,506 cases of meningitis were reported in 2 health districts with 232 deaths. The Ministry organized a partial vaccination response with the pre-positioned but insufficient vaccines. The vaccination reached 38,525 people aged 2 to 29 years. By mid-February the vaccination will be completed with the new vaccines procured by the Ministry with UNICEF support for the submission of the request to ICG. As for hepatitis E, 2,145 cases (39 deaths) have been registered in 2018 with a continue decrease since July, and only 25 cases in December. Finally, measles has not been registered in December but UNICEF supported the Regional Health Department for the organization of supplementary immunization activities against measles to reach over 52,592 in departments affected by the humanitarian crisis and with low vaccination coverage. Agadez region continued to receive migration flows of people in transit either towards or from Algeria and Libya. In December, 23 unaccompanied children, forced returnees from Algeria, have been supported including 16-year old girl, mother of two children aged 7 months and 3 years. The assistance included psychosocial support, food, health check-ups, facilitation of communication with families, NFI kits and support for transport to rejoin their families accompanied by social workers. Since the beginning of the year UNICEF, in collaboration with IOM and the regional decentralized technical services, has supported 76 children among forcibly returned migrants from Algeria. Following the decision of the Government of Niger to accept the transit of a certain number of migrant (asylum seekers), including children, coming back from detention in Libya, who suffered most horrible acts of torture, UNHCR is working on durable solution for their possible resettlement in Europe or North America and for the granting of refugee status. UNHCR approached UNICEF to support up to 70 children in alternative care centers originally set up for other categories of vulnerable children. In collaboration with UNHCR and COOPI, in December UNICEF supported 67 boys (54 from Eritrea and 13 from Somalia) and 5 girls in three alternative care centers. They received medical assistance, food, psychosocial support as well as recreational activities. UNHCR was working for a durable solution for 217 adults and 105 children, however the process for children is complex. The Best Interest Determination process (BID) takes time and efforts and future host countries have to ensure their agreement to receive unaccompanied children with no family members outside of Eritrea and Somalia.",1

As of 24 October, five cases have been reported – one confirmed case, one probable case with an epidemiological link to the confirmed case, and three suspected cases including two health workers.The affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus. The close proximity of the affected area to the Kenyan border, and cross-border movement between the affected district and Kenya and the potential transmission of the virus between colonies and to humans, increases the risk of cross-border spread.  These factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners. Tourism to Mount Elgon including the caves and surrounding areas should be noted and appropriate advice given and precautions taken. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low.",4

Wastewater Management: In Domiz 1 and 2 camps for example, the desludging of a high volume of wastewater is operationally challenging as well as costly. Moreover, raw waste is still being disposed directly into the environment without adequate treatment. Due to high capital cost for infrastructure, no plan is yet in place by any partner to fill the gap in the longer term. Inadequate water supply and low water quality: Over-reliance on groundwater supply in camps has led to excessive abstraction leading to some boreholes drying up or not working to full capacity. For example, 6 boreholes are closed due to high turbidity of 45 NTU (above recommended threshold) and others due to presence of nitrates in the groundwater around the camp. A longer-term solution is needed to construct a new water treatment plant that relies on surface water sourced from Mosul Dam. It is difficult to find a permanent solution for water provision to Basirma refugee camp whose borehole has dried up.

10239,"An animal health event of significance to public health is occurring in Namibia. On 1 October 2017, the wildlife authorities reported deaths of several hippopotamus (hippos) in Bwabwata National Park, Kavango East Region (which borders Botswana and Angola). Two successive aerial surveys conducted on 4 and 7 October 2017 counted 53 and 109 dead hippos, respectively. In addition, 20 buffalos were reported dead in the area. On 11 October 2017, samples collected from the hippo’s carcasses (by veterinary officers) showed Bacillus anthracis on blood smear microscopy. Additional samples were collected from hippos, buffalo and crocodiles and shipped to the Central Veterinary Laboratory for testing. To date, no suspected human cases have been reported. However, there were unconfirmed reports that community members in Kamutjonga village consumed meat from two hippos’ carcasses. This event in wildlife has triggered preparedness and response interventions by the public health authorities, including follow up and investigation of rumours, in order to prevent a possible outbreak of anthrax in humans. On 11 October 2017, dead hippos were reported in the Kavango River in Botswana, adjoining Bwabwata National Park. The river flows through Namibia before entering the Okavango Delta.Although no human infections have been reported thus far, mass animal deaths due to anthrax present a formidable public health risk. Earlier this year, severe human infections were associated with similar events in Zambia (87 suspected cases, 3 deaths) and Zimbabwe (11 suspected cases, 1 death). Immediate risks posed by such animal deaths include handling and consumption of contaminated meat by local communities (causing anthrax infections), as well as potential exposure of local authorities and others while disposing of animal carcasses. As anthrax spores are abundantly present on and inside carcasses, workers are at risk of both cutaneous and inhalational anthrax. Proper use of PPE is essential, as is the safe disposal of animal carcasses to prevent environmental contamination with anthrax spores, incineration being the preferred method. A collective One Health approach, with cross-border collaboration between Namibia, Botswana and Angola is urgently needed to control the event and prevent any human infections.",4

And any area that is off limits for attack will attract fighters, especially members of non-state armed groups, making them less safe. Safe zones by their nature are also rich sources for armed groups to grab aid and new recruits – putting civilians, including children, at additional risk. And the creation of safe zones may suggest that civilians not in safe zones somehow have fewer protections than those inside.

9731,"Rice, millet, sorghum, and maize are the primary staple foods in Senegal. Groundnuts are both an important source of protein and a commonly grown cash crop. Imported rice is consumed daily by the vast majority of households in Senegal particularly in Dakar and Touba urban centers. Local rice is produced and consumed in the Senegal River Valley. St. Louis is a major market for the Senegal River Valley. Millet is consumed in central regions where Kaolack is the most important regional market. Maize is produced and consumed in areas around Kaolack, Tambacounda, and the Senegal River Valley. Some maize is also imported mainly from the international market. High demand for all commodities exists in and around Touba and Dakar. They are also important centers for stocking and storage during the lean season. The harvests of grains and groundnuts begin at the end of the marketing year in October; and stocks of locally produced grains are drawn down throughout the marketing year. Senegal depends more on imports from the international market for rice than from cross border trade which mainly includes cattle from Mali and Mauritania that supply Dakar and surrounding markets",3

9222,"In the Philippines, I continue to be gravely concerned by the President's open support for a shoot-to-kill policy regarding suspects, as well as by the apparent absence of credible investigations into reports of thousands of extrajudicial killings, and the failure to prosecute any perpetrator. The recent killing of a schoolboy who was dragged into an alley and shot in the head by plains-clothed policeman on 16 August was described by the Minister of Justice as 'an isolated case'. However, suspicion of extrajudicial killings has now become so widespread that the initials EJK have reportedly become a verb in some communities – as in 'he was EJKed'. Two days after hundreds of people turned out for the teenager's funeral, the President again told police they would not be punished for killing suspects who resist arrest. This lack of respect for the due process rights of all Filipinos is appalling. I am also shocked by President Duterte's threat to bomb schools for indigenous children in the southern Philippines, which he said were teaching children to rebel against the government. His order to police to shoot any human rights workers who 'are part of' the drug trade or who 'obstruct justice' is yet another blow to his country's reputation and his people's rights. I remain concerned about the case of Senator de Lima. Many human rights defenders who are the honour of their country face a growing number of death threats, and I call on the Government to ensure they are accorded full protection and the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without reprisals. Measures taken towards a reintroduction of the death penalty threaten yet another step back. I urge the Government to uphold the Philippines' international human rights obligations, amid deeper reflection about the values that the Philippines stands for.",9

This led to maize harvests in April 2017, which were below normal but slightly better than last year. This maize lasted for about 1 to 2 months for households that could harvest, while other households harvested nothing. There are two possible seasons of sweet potatoes, the first in April and the second in August/September (planted in March/April). Some communities were only able to harvest the first season while others were able to harvest both . In Tsihombe and Beloha districts, some sweet potatoes are still in the field awaiting harvesting. Overall sweet potato production is expected to be higher than last year. Cassava harvests are expected to be below average although significantly better than last year. Cassava harvests stretched from July to September, with variations in harvest times between communities. Cassava is currently available in many communities and some is still being harvested. Legumes and pulses were also available from own harvest in April and July though they have mostly dried up. During the FEWS NET field assessment in October, the team observed only a few pulses as they have mostly dried up.

Concern is also high for Southern Agropastoral livelihood zone of Hiraan, and Hawd Pastoral and Coastral Deeh Pastoral livelihood zones.

14309,"February to May: Above average 2016/17 crop production in some northern and other surplus-producing areas will continue to ensure household access to own-produced food stocks between February and March. However, poor households in these areas would have exhausted own-produced stocks and will either rely on humanitarian assistance or purchases as well as facing livelihoods protection deficits. Below average green consumption is expected between February and March due to the impact of poor rains experienced up to the end of January. These areas will therefore be characterized by a combination of Minimal (IPC Phase 1) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) food security outcomes. These area outcomes are expected to continue between April and May, even as below normal harvests are expected. In deficit southern, western and extreme northern areas Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes will be experienced as very poor and poor households have long since exhausted own-produced stocks and are experiencing constrained livelihoods worsened by prevailing cash shortages. In a few districts, humanitarian assistance will be significant enough to change the food security outcomes to Stressed (IPC Phase 2!) between February and March. Little to no green consumption is expected in these areas in February and March. Significantly below normal harvests are expected between April and May. Compounded with poor livelihoods and household incomes, food security outcomes are likely to remain Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) from April through May in most areas, especially after humanitarian assistance ends in March.

A sustained increase in humanitarian assistance is needed in order to prevent food consumption gaps from widening and to prevent households from moving into Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). Based on recent model forecasts and an increased likelihood of La Niña development during late 2017, October to December 2017 Deyr rainfall is likely to be below average in southeastern Ethiopia. Following two consecutively very poor seasons, a poor Deyr 2017 season could lead to even further reductions in food access for many households, and drive further deteriorations in food security. In most high-producing areas of Ethiopia, Kiremt seasonal rainfall has been favorable for crop. However, infestations of Fall Armyworm (FAW) in western areas, as well as dry spells in some eastern and southern areas of the country may lead to below-average Meher production in some areas. Parts of Amhara, Tigray, northeastern SNNPR, and eastern Oromia are expected to remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) until Meher harvests begin in October. However, Meher harvests, coupled with seasonal increases in labor income from cereal and cash crop harvests, should drive improvements in household food access and acute food insecurity outcomes to Minimal (IPC Phase 1) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) levels between October 2017 and January 2018.",3

15281,"Afghanistan: Food Assistance Fact Sheet - Updated April 3, 2018More than three decades of war, sustained flows of returnees, civil unrest, insurgent activity and recurring natural disasters have contributed to chronic humanitarian need in Afghanistan. As of March, conflict has internally displaced over 42,200 people, 147,500 undocumented Afghans have returned from Iran and Pakistan and natural disasters have affected roughly 3,900 people since January, according to the UN.  Widespread conflict, poor rain-fed staple production and limited labor opportunities are the main drivers of acute food insecurity in Afghanistan, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) reports.According to the UN World Food Program (WFP), an estimated 9.3 million people are food insecure in Afghanistan—including 3.4 million severely food insecure; approximately 41 percent of children under 5 years of age are stunted and 10 percent suffer from acute malnutrition.  Afghanistan is experiencing below-average rainfall during the October 2017–May 2018 wet season, threatening agricultural outcomes of farmers and pastoralists in areas where March and April rainfall is critical for harvest outcomes and affects rangeland conditions. This will likely negatively affect food availability for many vulnerable communities throughout the January – April lean season—when food is most scarce for many households. In March, FEWS NET projected that an estimated 4–5 million people will face Crisis (IPC 3) or worse levels of food insecurity outcomes during the 2018 lean season.",3

The lean season occurs from May to August, however due to high risk of natural hazards during the monsoon season, the lean season often extends from May to September. Each year it is more difficult for people to cope with the lean season, as food stocks from the previous harvest are limited, there are few employment opportunities and therefore purchasing power is low. There are key factors that are likely to exacerbate the impact of the lean season in the CHT: the region is facing a decline of resources due to land scarcity.
