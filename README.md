# üëãWelcome to my portfolio!
Hello! I'm Giulia, a passionate AI enthusiast on the cusp of completing my Bachelor's degree in AI (expected latest in June 2024). With a strong foundation in languages and translation, I bring a unique perspective to the world of artificial intelligence. <br>

# üìùList of projects in the repository:
*(In chronological order)*
1. üé∂ [Music Retrieval System](https://github.com/Giuliasdfghjk/Portfolio/tree/main/Music_Retrieval_System): I implemented 11 music retrieval systems, experimenting with diverse feature embeddings and fusion approaches, utilizing standard techniques, and crafting personalized algorithms when needed (e.g. late fusion method). For each of the c.a. 10,100 query, top 100 most similar items were retrieved. Evaluation was carried out via accuracy (i.e. Precision, Recall, nDCG) and beyond-accuracy (Genre coverage and diversity) metrics. I also created a UI to show top 10 retrieved items for every query song, which can be found [here](https://multimediasearch-ui-5sbvf4gb6xjzgnewswoa9w.streamlit.app/).<br> <br>*Dataset: [Music4All Onion dataset](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3511808.3557656)* <br><br>


2. üìÑ [Document Classification](https://github.com/Giuliasdfghjk/Portfolio/tree/main/Document_Classification): I experimented with various architectures, including Transformers, LSTM, K-NN, Random Forest, tf-idf embedding, to perform a multilabel classification task involving 12 distinct classes across a diverse set of documents. The primary objective was to gain a comprehensive understanding of how different parameters and models impact performance. To achieve this, I implemented from scratch the attention mechanism from the [famous paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and trained each model with a wide range of parameter variations. The project was evaluated using accuracy as the metric. Document Classification is essential for organizing and categorizing vast amounts of textual data, facilitating tasks such as information retrieval, content recommendation, and sentiment analysis, making it a crucial component of natural language processing and data analysis. <br> <br> *Dataset: [HumSet](https://blog.thedeep.io/humset/)*<br><br>

3. üíä [Drug Bioactivity Prediction](https://github.com/Giuliasdfghjk/Portfolio/tree/main/Drug_Activity_Prediction): This project aims to predict the activity of unseen compounds from their SMILES string representation. Leveraging the power of RDKit, an open-source toolkit for cheminformatics, and employing various resampling techniques from the SMOTE family, I conducted a thorough analysis. The outcome has been evaluated based on the mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) measure, demonstrating its significant utility in advancing compound activity prediction in the field of cheminformatics. The potential applications of this work extend to drug discovery, where it can aid in identifying new and promising compounds with specific activities, potentially leading to the development of innovative pharmaceutical solutions.

4. üí∂ [Cost-sensitive Emotion Prediction](https://github.com/BianchiGiulia/Portfolio/tree/main/Cost-sentitive_Classification): This collection of Jupyter notebooks showcases various ensemble machine learning techniques aimed at predicting emotional responses to music, incorporating a cost-sensitive framework to account for the economic impact of misclassification. The models are evaluated based on their ability to maximize revenue by accurately aligning predictions with a predefined cost matrix, demonstrating the importance of cost-efficient predictions in enhancing business strategies and decision-making processes.

5. üè® [Amsterdam Airbnb Listing Data Analysis](https://github.com/Giuliasdfghjk/Portfolio/tree/main/Airbnb_Data_Analysis): I conductive an extensive exploratory data analysis on Airbnb Amsterdam Listings to uncover patterns, trends, outliers, and unusual distributions within the data, providing valuable insights into the Amsterdam Airbnb market. Preprocessing, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, clustering techniques and visualization were conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and extract meaningful information that can inform decision-making and strategy development within the Amsterdam Airbnb market.

6. üñºÔ∏è [Image Border Extraction](https://github.com/Giuliasdfghjk/Portfolio/tree/main/Image_Extraction-SimpleCNN): In a comprehensive data-driven initiative, I, witht he help of my colleagues at the university, meticulously assembled a dataset comprising 40,000 fragmented images, subjecting them to rigorous preprocessing and random border cropping. By training a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our project centers on the precise reconstruction of missing image data, unearthing concealed information and advancing the field of visual data analysis.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Projects Work in Progress:
(as of Feb 2024)
1. [News Recommender System](https://github.com/Giuliasdfghjk/Portfolio/tree/main/News_Recommendation_System): This project aims to develop a sophisticated News Recommender System that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide personalized news recommendations to users. The system is designed to analyze large volumes of news data, understand user preferences, and deliver relevant news articles that align with individual interests and reading habits.
