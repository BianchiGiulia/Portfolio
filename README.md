# 👋Welcome to my portfolio!
Hello! I'm Giulia, a passionate AI enthusiast on the cusp of completing my Bachelor's degree in AI (expected latest in June 2024). With a strong foundation in languages and translation, I bring a unique perspective to the world of artificial intelligence. <br>

# 📝List of projects in the repository:

1. 🎶 [Music Retrieval System](https://github.com/Giuliasdfghjk/Portfolio/tree/main/Music_Retrieval_System): I implemented 11 music retrieval systems, experimenting with diverse feature embeddings and fusion approaches, utilizing standard techniques, and crafting personalized algorithms when needed. For each of the c.a. 10,100 query, top 100 most similar items were retrieved. Evaluation was carried out via accuracy (i.e. Precision, Recall, nDCG) and beyond-accuracy (Genre coverage and diversity) metrics. I also created a UI to show top 10 retrieved items for every query song, which can be found [here](https://multimediasearch-ui-5sbvf4gb6xjzgnewswoa9w.streamlit.app/).<br> <br>*Dataset: [Music4All Onion dataset](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3511808.3557656)* <br>


2. 📄 [Document Classification](https://github.com/Giuliasdfghjk/Portfolio/tree/main/Document_Classification): I experimented with various architecture such as Transformers, LSTM, K-NN, Random Forest, tf-idf and more, to carry out a multilabel (12 classes) classification task on a range of documents. The main goal is to get a basic understanding of how different parameters affect the performance; therefore for each model a range of variation has been trained too. I used accuracy as metric. <br> <br> *Dataset: [HumSet](https://blog.thedeep.io/humset/)*
