Multiple actors deliver the main source of funding for the health care system, mainly through social and private insurance schemes [25].

In addition to having a direct impact on the risk of SGBV and accidents when accessing WASH facilities by night female FGD participants reported that this situation greatly impacts their hygiene, health and nutrition as women. In particular, women are restricting their daily food and water intake to avoid having to use latrines as often. INCREASE OF Gender Based Violence WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD: several women in each female FGD reported that the lack of burkas is creating tension in their households. Wives either have to break purdah to fetch water to cook or respect purdah and stay in, however both choices expose them to the risk of domestic violence from their husbands. One male FGD confirmed this situation, explaining to Oxfam teams “women cannot provide tea and men have to punish them because they do not accomplish their household chores”.

Those services are available in the camps however, in the FGD performed in Unchiprang camp respondents stated that women would not access those services unless it was an extreme emergency. Upholding of purdah is prioritized over accessing humanitarian services available in the camps. Oxfam teams furthermore witnessed high levels of trauma among FGD participants. Multiple female participants were visibly distressed, constantly mentioning the horrendous events they witnessed in their last days in Myanmar no matter what subject was discussed. It should be noted that both male and female FGDs stated they want one-on-one PSS, with men mentioning that they would like a male safe space where they could talk about their fear and anger.

Since late September, health actors have recorded at least 88 suspected cholera cases in Juba, where humanitarian organizations recently reached nearly 173,000 people through an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign. Meanwhile, health actors in Fangak have not recorded new suspected cholera cases in the county since confirming and treating seven cases in late September. ? On October 25, the national cholera task force—chaired by the GoRSS Ministry of Health (MoH), with support from UN agencies and other humanitarian organizations—convened to review the current cholera caseload and status of response activities in South Sudan. As part of ongoing response efforts, health actors are deploying OCV doses to locations with active transmission to prevent further spread of the disease, transporting more than 1.1 million OCV doses to high-risk areas to date in 2017.

13786,"Displacement and destruction of homes and infrastructure have caused significant shelter needs in north-east Nigeria. Key sectoral vulnerabilities and shelter assessments reveal that more than 2.1 million people will require shelter and non-food items (NFIs) assistance in 2018. This includes 1.6 million IDPs, 265,000 people living in host communities, and 270,000 returnees in need of shelter and NFI support. Overall, 55 per cent of the people in need are women and girls. Shelter needs patterns have shifted since the beginning of the crisis, in line with various waves of displacement, new arrivals and returns. The vast majority of the people (86 per cent) fled their homes before 2016, though ongoing military operations and attacks are also continuing to cause fresh displacements particularly with people arriving from inaccessible areas. Over one third of affected people are currently living in emergency family shelters, while another third lives in self-made or makeshift shelters. About 23 per cent of IDPs live in collective shelters (such as schools, government buildings, community centres, etc.) The transitional needs of returnees, though shaped by very different dynamics, are also significant. Out of the 1.3 million people assessed in returns area, the majority returned three years ago (in 2014), while 11 per cent returned in 2015, 8 per cent in 2016, and 5 per cent in 2017. Nearly one quarter of returnees assessed in return areas (nearly 50,000 households) live in inadequate shelters, with 86 per cent (40,000 households) of these in partially damaged housing. A lack of capital to purchase building materials undermines opportunities for stimulating early recovery in areas of return. NFIs remain the second most reported need of affected people in north-east Nigeria, both in host communities and in camp or camplike settings, where the provisions of NFIs has not been systematic for new arrivals due to the lack of prepositioned items in key receiving areas. The three main NFIs requested by the affected people are mats (41 per cent), mosquito nets (29 per cent), and kitchen sets (20 per cent). While over 70,000 households benefitted from NFI assistance in the past year, significant needs remain, in part due to continuous population movements and the short lifespan of shelter-related NFIs, which implies a constant need for replenishment.",10

However, the atypical extension of rains into the harvesting period is likely to result in post-harvest losses, reducing the supply, and maintaining maize prices at 24 – 26 percent above average. The short rains are expected to improve forage and water availability, resulting in improved food and milk consumption across most of the country. Nurses’ return to work is expected to increase health and nutrition activities, leading to typical improvements usually observed in nutritional status from late November through January. At a macro level, regional and international maize imports are expected to increase by 50 percent from January onwards, following increased availability from harvests in Ethiopia and Uganda, increasing supply and moderating atypically early and rapid price increases. With the availability of the long rains harvest and regional and international imports facilitating good food access, the high and medium-producing areas are likely to experience Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes. By mid to late December, across the pastoral areas, there are expected improvements, which will be largely reflected in higher livestock productivity levels. This is likely to lead to higher food and income sources and an improvement to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes. In some eastern pastoral areas, even if total cumulative rainfall is below-average, the short rains are still likely to be sufficient to register an improvement in forage and water resources since the rainfall deficits were not as severe during the 2017 long rains in most areas, outside of Isiolo. However, emergency humanitarian assistance will still likely be required for some of the most vulnerable households, who will still experience Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes at the end of January.

States like Borno, Plateau and Yobe experienced below average production due to insecurity and recurrent communal clasheswhich prevented the farmers from cultivating. Food availability in most states is expected to decline normally  towards the lean season (June – August 2017), although the impact may be reduced with irrigated farming.

Many IDP camps and settlements lack access to basic necessities due to a shortage of funding and a lack of effective coordination among humanitarian actors.

Conflict continues to affect civilians’ ability and strategies to cope with the drought, while the drought and humanitarian action influence conflict, political, and protection dynamics. To continue to achieve the greatest impact of life-saving interventions it remains essential to understand these dynamics and their impact on the situation of individuals, families, and populations. Incidents of GBV continue to be reported, predominantly in IDP sites. Forced evictions, often related to disputes over the amount of ‘rent’, continue unabated. So far (Jan-Aug) NRC has recorded more than 110,000 individuals as directly affected, primarily in Mogadishu, but instances continue to be reported in Baidoa (over 5,000 individuals affected). Forced recruitment remains a concern. Between January – August 1, 202 children have been affected. Child recruitment is also a driver of displacement with communities from Galgaduud and Lower Shabelle reported to move out of their places of origin due to pressure from non-state armed actors in areas under their control to offer children as recruits. Some 34 people (27 children) were killed or maimed from January to August due to mines and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW), while IEDs, including pressure plate operated, caused 452 civilian casualties. Ongoing conflict exacerbates the problem of explosive hazard contaminations.Insecurity continue to be a major protection concerns and limits protection partners’ ability to ensure effective protection monitoring. Remoteness, ad-hoc checkpoints and general inaccessibility to the conflict-affected areas. • Without additional funding many vulnerable group or persons with specific needs (women, children, and elderly) are exposed to potential protection risks and without access to specialized services. • The presence of mines and ERW continued to threaten the lives and livelihoods of civilians, and to compromise the ability of humanitarian partners to safely carry out their duties. Constraints related to access (unable to provide protection services, clear roads, etc.) • Limited IDTR and GBV services for families, children and survivors of rape and sexual violence etc. in priority locations including Awdal, Bari, Banadir, Bay, Gaalkacyo, Gedo, Hiraan, Sool, Sanag, Nugaal and Lower Juba. Countrywide, referral pathways need to be extended.For various reasons sex, age, and diversity data disaggregation is applied inconsistently, hampering analysis of assessment data. Increased inter-cluster data analysis remains a priority. • Security of tenure for IDPs is limited, increasing the risk of forced evictions, especially for newly arrived IDPs who frequently rely on oral tenure agreements for sites they settle on. • The under-reporting of GBV cases in some communities is attributed to cultural norms and social stigma for survivors",9

The safe-passage corridors — including routes through Houthi-controlled territory — would be placed on no-strike lists that exempt them from targeting by coalition warplanes, the statement said.

7247,"Between June and September 2017, severe levels of food insecurity are expected in all counties of concern. The peak of the lean season is expected in July, after which households will have some access to green harvest in August. Although some households are expected to have increased access to income through new job opportunities, few have access to markets, and where cereals for purchase are accessible, prices are expected to be 10 times or more above average. Households will rely primarily on the consumption of wild foods and fish, the availability of which will seasonally increase over this time period. With relative stability allowing for continued humanitarian access, food assistance plans are likely to be implemented and maintain Crisis (IPC Phase 3!) in Panyijiar. In Leer, Mayendit, and Koch, though, insecurity may threaten humanitarian access at times. In the event of access constraints, and absence of humanitarian assistance, Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is expected.Improvements in food security are expected between October and January as the availability of wild foods and fish further increases and the main harvest begins. Given relatively better security in Panyijiar, it is likely that a higher proportion of households planted in these counties and they will harvest a greater amount. With greater access to cereals from production, households in Panyijiar are expected to improve to Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are also expected in Koch for similar reasons, and because more households have access to some livestock products. However, it is expected some households in Koch will remain in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). In Leer and Mayendit, where a relatively low proportion of poor and displaced households were likely able to cultivate, food security is not expected to improve significantly. In the absence of humanitarian assistance, Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are expected to persist. Concern will remain high for the estimated 10,000 people isolated on remote islands, many of whom lack access to humanitarian assistance. It is feared outcomes will be worse among these populations, who will rely on wild foods and fish. Some households may be in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) during the outlook period and a risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) exists throughout 2017.",3

10529,"4.5 million people in need of WASH.Water shortages continue to affect pastoralists and riverine communities as well as IDPs in Lower Juba, Gedo and Galmudug regions. All water catchments and underground water tanks have dried out in most of the areas where slight rains were received during the Gu season. Shallow wells in most areas have either dried or the salinity has become very high, hence not consumable for both livestock and humans. Rural communities who lost their livestock due to drought moved to urban and semi urban settlements including IDP camps in search of basic service. They are straining existing WASH facilities such as water sources, sanitation facilities and compromising hygiene practices in these areas.It is important to not only focus on emergency short-term solutions but develop sustainable solutions to these problems. In Lower Juba, WASH gaps including access to safe and reliable water sources (especially in Afmadow district, Abdille Birole land recent liberated areas like Gobweyne, Qamqam and Bula Gudud.) were reported. Lack of access to latrines for over 5,000 families were also reported. Approximately 70 per cent of latrines within Kismayo IDP camps are full and need desludging.

There is also need for the construction of culturally sensitive latrines to meet the needs of affected populations, distribution of hygiene kits and enhance adoption of appropriate hygiene and sanitation practices through hygiene promotion interventions.There is also needed for strengthened local capacities especially WASH committees for operation and maintenance of WASH facilities. • WASH activities need to be scaled up in rural areas to avoid further displacements and encourage IDPs to return back to their rural homes • For flood-affected communities, there is an urgent need for provision of safe water, enhanced sanitation access and hygiene promotion initiatives alongside distribution of hygiene kits.

16742,"By early May, rainfall countrywide reached or exceeded total March to May seasonal averages, with some areas exceeding the historical record by more than 250 millimeters. Flooding was particularly severe in Tana River, Turkana, Kisumu, Mandera, and Kilifi, where major rivers overflowed and displaced more than 200,000 people. Some households have not received adequate food assistance and are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes as they lost their farms and large numbers of livestock, destroying their main livelihoods. FEWS NET is closely monitoring highly populated flood-prone southwestern areas, with above-average rainfall forecast through June.  In marginal agricultural areas, despite the flooding impacts, including several thousand hectares of cropland, the rains have been largely beneficial, driving crop development and mitigating Fall Armyworm infestations. Casual labor opportunities continue to provide income for needed market purchases ahead of the June harvest. Despite improved food access, the majority of poor households continued to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes.  In the pastoral areas, with significant regeneration of rangeland resources, livestock body conditions have further improved, leading to above-average livestock prices. With better milk access at the household level and improved terms of trade, except in Garissa and Turkana where above-normal maize prices have constrained household purchasing power, more households are able to move to Stressed (IPC Phase 2). However, a number of poor households are still experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes in Tana River, Garissa, Turkana, Isiolo, and Kajiado.   Across the urban reference markets, April maize and bean prices ranged from 6 – 17 percent below the five-year average due to increased local supply from initial harvests and cross-border imports. However, bean prices were eight and 10 percent above the five-year average in Kisumu and Nairobi, respectively, caused by reduced and relatively higher priced supplies, mostly imports.

During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, precious time was wasted waiting for Congress to allocate appropriate funding to the outbreak, and we can’t afford to repeat this mistake. Congress deserves credit for creating an “Emergency Reserve Fund” for contagious infectious disease outbreaks with a domestic focus, but the account only has $105 million—which could be rapidly exhausted in the face of a pandemic.

While it is difficult to estimate the numbers of rapes that occurred, humanitarian organizations working with refugees in the camps in Bangladesh have reported receiving dozens or sometimes hundreds of cases.Some witnesses reported seeing women raped and then killed. Others do not report rape because of the deep stigma that makes survivors reluctant to seek assistance.

They have also revealed cumbersome for local authorities, which are not in a position to adequately manage them and prevent adverse effects for the population, in particular individuals with specific needs. These procedures have also remained influenced by area of origin and intended destination of IDPs, leading to inconsistencies in their implementation. Certain categories of individuals have indeed managed to be exempted from the sponsorship system, if directed to specific destinations (e.g. Azaz, Jarablus); if returning to Tabqa or to areas of origin in Northern Raqqa; or if requesting to go by flight back to Damascus. Nevertheless, unpredictability is increasing. The rest of the displaced population remains subject to the requirement of finding a sponsor outside of the transit sites. In turn, sponsors need to complete several bureaucratic steps with civilian and security authorities before being able to guarantee the exit of the individual or the family. Confiscation of identity documents at checkpoints and delayed restitution has generated situations where documents have been lost or left behind by families prioritising the exit from the sites to any other condition.

Currently, the major risk factors for the spread of the outbreak are holy water sites where large numbers of Christian pilgrims congregate from around the country, especially in Amhara and Tigray, and seasonal mobility of daily laborers to commercial farms.With the limited resources available, the Federal Ministry of Health and Regional Health Bureaus, with support from partners, are implementing multi-sector preventive and control measures. In Tigray region for example, the number of districts affected by the outbreak is slowly decreasing. At the peak of the crisis, 80 per cent of the region was affected. In Amhara region, the regional president held a meeting with private investors to encourage their participation in the ongoing AWD outbreak prevention and response efforts, as well as in addressing other public health threats. Urgent additional support is needed to increase response capacity and case management, together with increased WaSH sector involvement. The high risk for further spread of the AWD outbreak continues due to the degradation of health determinants on the back drop of overburdened local health systems, including inadequate access to safe drinking water and internal and cross-border movements.",4

A reduction in the household purchasing power due to the macro-economic deterioration is likely to have contributed to the stabilization of prices through a decline in market demand. However, prices remained at record or near-record highs after the sharp increases of the previous months, which were mainly driven by the removal of the wheat subsidies in the 2018 budget (FPMA Food Policies) and by a strong depreciation of the local currency. The exchange rate of the Sudanese Pound declined sharply in late 2017 after the international sanctions were lifted in October 2017 ending a trade embargo and unfreezing financial assets. The removal of subsidies on electricity, coupled with limited availabilities and higher prices of fuel, further increased inflationary pressures. Localized but substantial crop production shortfalls, affecting the 2017 harvest, provided further support to the prices of cereals. According to the findings of the 2017 FAO Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM report), the 2017 aggregate cereal production is estimated at 5.2 million tonnes, 40 percent lower than the record 2016 output. This is mainly due to a decline in the area planted with sorghum and millet, following farmers’ decision to switch to more profitable crops and to production shortfalls in Kassala, Gedaref and North Darfur states, where the output contracted by 66-90 percent from the previous year following poor and erratic rainfall.",3

This is the time between harvests, when food often runs scarce.  The hunger gap is taking a particularly heavy toll this year due to a combination of environmental and economic factors, the impact of the ongoing conflict and a lack of aid provision.  Irregular rains have reduced the quality and quantity of crops available. Recent clashes blocked the main supply road from the capital city, Juba, for several months, reducing the quantity of food available.  Food prices have also risen dramatically; the cost of some basic food items, such as sorghum, has quadrupled in the past three months. There is also a larger population living in the area, after people relocated from Juba to Pibor due to insecurity.",8

15679,"Following the recent rains, pasture regeneration is expected in some parts of the belg growing areas, allowing the recovery of livestock body condition. The belg growing areas are highlighted in red in Figure 4; the green shaded areas have received a normal to above normal amount of rainfall. However, in most places (the areas highlighted in yellow), rains have been inadequate. In most of these areas, expectations are also that rainfall will not improve this season. Coupled with the previous below-average rainy seasons, pastures are expected to exhaust around mid-2018. Therefore, provision of feed for core breeding livestock, animal health services and destocking of unproductive livestock is required. According to the March-May meteorological forecast, the gu rains in the Somali region are expected to underperform, which will negatively affect the recovery of pasture and improvement of livestock body conditions. As a result, the current ‘lean season’ in south eastern parts of the country is expected to extend to May even though there are signs that the current La Niña is weakening. During the March-May period, replenishment of ground water sources is expected to bring some respite to communities in Afar region during the sugum rains. However, the gu rains are expected to be poor. This will likely lead to limited pasture and livestock recovery in areas that have been depending on water trucking.

The Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, an engineer had told the council that the WASH sector is currently in crisis situation and requires urgent action for its revitalization.  The Minister explained that the action plan would set out a 13-year revitalization strategy for WASH sector including 18 months emergency phase and five years recovery plan adding that it would provide for concrete actions to be taken by both Federal and State Governments under five components comprising governance, sustainability, funding, financing and monitoring and evaluation.  According to a statement signed by the Director Press in the ministry, Mrs Kenechukwu Offie, the minister explained that the Action Plan includes the establishment of a National WASH Fund as a tool for the promotion of renewed Federal-State partnership and increased financial investment for WASH so as to measure up to regional level of funding.  Adamu said the National WASH Action Plan would change the worrisome situation and reverse the ugly trend while the declaration of state of emergency on the sector will change the narrative.  He said following the national declaration, States and Local Governments are expected to follow suit, through increasing their political and financial commitment to the WASH Sector.  He then commended the Federal Government for providing the leadership and demonstrating the necessary political will at the highest level by declaring state of emergency in the WASH Sector.

Knowing with whom and how to share key messages about AWD was essential to curbing the outbreak.  Additionally, the clear and elaborate administrative system in Somali Region, and throughout Ethiopia, is suitable for implementing effective community engagement.The main reason for low compliance with the WASH messages was shortage of water, particularly in arid rural areas, where people must choose between using their meagre water supply for drinking, food preparation or for sanitary purposes. In Somali Region, as in other places undergoing severe drought, shortage of safe water remains an important factor in AWD prevention and control.  There are knowledge gaps that require direct community engagement regarding the safety of water treatment chemicals, poor eating behaviors and sanitation practices. Some people live in “hard-to-reach” areas, requiring extra effort and different targeting strategies to reach them with AWD messages.  Overall community engagement using individual counselling, house-to-house mobilization, community meetings and use of religious institutions are proving invaluable in mobilizing communities for AWD action. Most importantly, community leaders in the region now appreciate that community engagement is their responsibility and that it has to continue even after AWD comes to an end.  For community engagement activities to bring about lasting change, they need to be complemented with other interventions including the provision of safe water, adequate supply of water treatment tablets and construction of latrines. This requires a multi-sectoral response and coordination between various stakeholders in the health and water management arenas.",4

6321,"In Niger, the food security situation has remained difficult in several parts of the country due to the lingering effects of the previous food crises and the impact of recent years’ of erratic rains leading crops and pastures deficits in some regions. In 2017 dry matter stocks is getting scarce. Global balance deficit calculated by authorities is over 12 million tons, about 48% of the theoretical overall requirements estimated at 25.6 million tons (PREGEC, March 2017). This represents 4 to 5 months of consumption on the 9 month. Additionally, the drying up of several ponds and water points endangers livestock production in some areas. The availability of cereals remains varied in the markets followed, either because of the isolation of the locality or the bad state of the roads (Agadez, north of Diffa and Tahoua), the security situation (north Tllaberi and Bosso) or the deficit Of production recorded this year (Abala, Guidan Roumdji, Loga, Ouallam, Mayahi). The Niger is highly dependent on imports of coarse grains (millet, sorghum and maize) from its neighbours, Benin and Nigeria, to cover its cereal requirements. The strong demand from institutional bodies for the replenishment of their stocks have also put pressure on cereal prices in recent months. (FAO) The upward trend in cereal prices bases is due to: ? A launch of the marketing period with intense levels of trade due to the early influx of traders and households rebuilding their stock; ? A decrease in local supply caused by production deficits in areas of usually high yields such as the departments of Mayahi, Guidan Roumdji and North Dakoro in the Maradi region, which resulted in a reversal of internal trade flows; ? A potential effect due to the launch of the government's 30,000-tonne national tenders for the replenishment of the National Security Stock in November 2016 (Cf: Bulletin Albichir de N°85); ? Non-official export restrictions along the Nigerian border; ? The economic situation (continued depreciation of the naira, rise in prices at source), with a consequent reduction in incentives for Niger traders to import from Nigerian markets; The price of millet is up compared to the same period of 2016 and average of the last five years.

The atypically low maize prices expected through May should more easily facilitate needed market food purchases . As the harvests start (ranging from March in the south to late April in the far north) , most poor households will gradually reduce their dependency on coping strategies and market purchases to meet their food needs. At the peak of the lean season, FEWS NET estimates that the number of food insecure people facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity will be well below the five -year average, including potential flood or cyclone-affected people, who may require emergency food assistance depending on the magnitude of the disaster. From April onwards, with the availability of harvested crops, most poor households , including those in Chemba District, are expected to be accessing food from their own production and their acute food insecurity outcomes will lessen and are likely to range from either Stressed (IPC Phase 2) to None (IPC Phase 1), depending on the severity of their previous situation.

However, if there is a localized poor harvest in April, this is not likely to have a significant impact during the scenario period through May 2018, but could potentially later when household stocks deplete earlier than normal . The forecast for enhanced cyclonic activity and above-average rainfall could cause localized flooding in some of the major basins. Depending on the extent of any flooding, which is possible through March, some flood -affected households may still face food gaps until they recover through post-flood production in May/June. ",3

There was only an exchange of fire between the regime forces and the factions in addition to the dropping of a number of shells at midnight yesterday.

This prevailing calm came as a result of the agreement after the city had witnessed the fiercest battles since the implementation of the “de-escalation zones” agreement on the 6th of May 2017 between the regime forces, their allied militiamen and Lebanese Hezbollah on one hand and the rebel and Islamic factions and fighters of Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham on the other in areas in Daraa al-Balad and in the vicinity of Daraa camp from the 3rd till the afternoon of the 17th of June 2017.

17145,"  Drought grips large parts of AfghanistanNimroz Province, close to Chakhansur: the ongoing drought has dried up wells, rivers, fountains and water points. Credit: Relief International  A drought is affecting two out of three provinces across Afghanistan, meaning that more than 2 million people are expected to become severely food insecure and in desperate need of life-saving humanitarian assistance in the coming six months.  In recent months, a precipitation deficit of 70 per cent has been registered across most of Afghanistan due to La Niña conditions, and this year’s main harvest is expected to be below average for the fifth consecutive year. Agriculture is one of the country’s main livelihoods, with nearly 15 million people relying on farming, livestock or agriculture-related labour opportunities in the 20 provinces most affected by the drought.  “Afghanistan has three harvests during the year, and we lost the first one, which accounts for about half of the entire harvests,” said Toby Lanzer, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan. “I do fear that without quick action now, the number of families affected by the drought will grow precipitously.”  Water points and fountains across the country have dried up, and rivers have run low or dried up. In many cases, farmers could do nothing but watch their seeds dry out and their crops fail. Herders could not find any pastures, and tens of thousands of sheep and goats have died.  With nearly 15 million people relying on farming, livestock or agriculture-related labour opportunities in the 20 provinces most affected by the drought, more than 2 million people are expected to become severely food insecure. Credit: WFP  In the Western Region, which is hardest hit by the drought, farmers have given up hope for the harvest. To save their cattle, they started feeding them with the wheat that could not germinate. More than 20,000 people have already migrated from Badghis and Ghor Provinces, both in the Western Region, to neighbouring Hirat Province due to the drought. They received life-saving humanitarian assistance including food, emergency shelter and essential household items from authorities, United Nations agencies and NGOs.  Complementary to the Government’s response, the humanitarian community is seeking to assist 1.4 million of the most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men affected by the drought as part of the revised financial requirements of the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which now calls for US$117 million in addition to the $430 million requested at the beginning of the year.  “This is a natural disaster, this is not Afghanistan’s fault,” stressed Mr. Lanzer. “We are asking the international community to show real empathy, because people will need either food or cash so that they can access markets where there still is food. If people are given minimum amounts of cash, they will be able to continue to access markets, then we could avert what I have described as untenable hunger six months down the road.”  The Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) for Afghanistan is already addressing the effects of the drought by providing approximately $1.2 million for food, water, sanitation and drought-tolerant wheat seeds to communities living in the hardest-hit areas of Badghis Province. The CHF was the second largest funder of the 2017 Afghanistan HRP, but contributions are still needed to enable the CHF to deliver urgent and life-saving assistance in 2018 for the drought and other priority humanitarian needs in Afghanistan.",3

16093,"In March 2018, the market supply of staple cereals is satisfactory except in pastoral zones of the North. Food availability for rural households is currently improved through the presence of garden produce (lettuce, cabbage, squash, potatoes, etc.) and the start of the operation '' vente de céréales à prix modéré ''. Currently, the average price of millet is above 200 FCFA / kg on almost in all regional capitals. Given these high price levels, access to cereals for poor households is seriously affcted. In the projected situation (June to September 2018), price levels could reach at least 260 FCFA / kg for millet on almost all markets monitored. (Source: Albichir No102 Mars 2018) Analysis of current cross border millet prices shows that price differences are relatively favorable to the import of millet and maize from Malanville in Benin and Illela in Nigeria. Terms of trade for goat versus millet remained almost constant during this month in most livestock markets. For instance, on the market of Abalak / Tahoua which is a pastoral livelhood area, the sale of a goat only allows the breeder to acquire only 35 kg of millet against 36 kg February 2018. This situation could be explained by a stable price of goat and millet on this market. The terms of trade are drastically down from the five-year average which allowed to acquire up to 80 kg of millet. The terms of trade (onion/millet) on the Agadez market indicate a 17% decrease in opportunities for access to onion farmers' cereals. In March 2018, a bag of 100 kilograms of onion trades for 97 kg of millet against 117 kg in February 2018 and 120 kg for the five year average. One could expect an increase in the prices of the main agricultural products, because of the upcoming start of Ramadan, when cereal demand is on the rise. However, this increase could be mitigated by the continuation of the operation '' vente de céré- ales à prix modéré ''. As an example, in Téra, 80 000 tonnes of cereals will be made available to 150 000 households from February to September. (Source: Albichir No102 Mars 2018)",3

The National Bolivarian Guard (GNB) arrived on the scene to divide opposition supporters and bakery workers outside the bakery on Baralt Avenue.Last week community councils, Local Food Production and Provision Committees (CLAPs), and collectives including La Minka from the Altagracia parish of Caracas took over the Mansion Bakery after it was sanctioned with a 90 day temporary closure by the government's Superintendency for Fair Prices (SUNDDE) for violating health codes, refusal to abide by the government’s price controls on goods and low levels of production. La Minka is now running the bakery, and supplying bread directly to the government's CLAPs in Altagracia to ensure its sale at fair prices to surrounding communities.In the days leading up to Tuesday night’s aggression, private media publicly campaigned against La Minka bakery citing alleged unjust firings of former workers, unsanitary working conditions and the community’s dissatisfaction with the new distribution system. Some outlets also reported that the government and occupying groups had 'stolen' from the 'hardworking' families who previously owned the bakery, while internet memes drawing attention to the social and racial background of the grassroots groups suggested that they were incapable of running the bakery. According to Carolina Cestari, the Director of the Capital District Government, the former owners of the bakery were guilty of selling bread at 400% more than its regulated price, despite receiving government subsidised flour.Last week, the Venezuelan government took-over two bakeries for failure to comply with price controls.
