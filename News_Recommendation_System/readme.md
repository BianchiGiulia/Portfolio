News Recommender System (⚠️Work in Progress⚠️) 
==========================================

Project Overview
----------------

This project aims to develop a sophisticated News Recommender System that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide personalized news recommendations to users. The system is designed to analyze large volumes of news data, understand user preferences, and deliver relevant news articles that align with individual interests and reading habits.

Current Status
--------------

_Work in Progress_: The project is currently under development (As of Jan, 2024), and the current version includes exploratory data analysis + basic functionality for news retrieval and preliminary user preference modeling.


### Upcoming Features

*   Integration of advanced NLP techniques for better understanding of news content.
*   Enhanced user profiling via political ideology detection, using [POLITICS](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-naacl.101/).
*   Feature engineering based on field-specific knowledge (e.g. writing style, tone, lexicon simplicity etc..)
*   Implementation of a more sophisticated recommendation algorithm, most certainly Transformer based.
