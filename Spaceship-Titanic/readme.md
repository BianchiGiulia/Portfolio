Spaceship Titanic <br>

This notebook is my solution to [this Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview). <br> It should be noted that the highest test accuracy reached is ~0.78 with Random Forest classifier, yet in the last part of the notebook there is more code, a new approach to data preprocessing to increase accuracy but it is <i>work in progress</i>.
