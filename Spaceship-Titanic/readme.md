Spaceship Titanic Analysis 
==========================
(*2022*) <br>

Introduction
------------

This project is part of the Kaggle challenge "Spaceship Titanic". The challenge involves predicting which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly. The aim is to use machine learning to analyze the characteristics of passengers and predict their likelihood of being transported.

Dataset
-------

The dataset provided by Kaggle ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data) includes various features about the passengers, such as age, cabin, and travel information. It is split into training and testing sets, with the training set containing an additional 'Transported' column indicating whether the passenger was transported.


Methodology
-----------

This notebook includes data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing steps. Different machine learning models are evaluated, with a focus on accuracy in predicting the 'Transported' status of passengers.

Results
-------
SCORE - 0.78793 2nd try - Random Forest Grid Search.
More algorithm implementation (and more advanced preprocessing tecniques) will be deployed to allow for comparison and improvement.
